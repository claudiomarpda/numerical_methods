<h2>3. Systems of Linear Algebric Equations</h2>
<h3>Determine the values of X1, X2, ..., Xn, which simultaneously satisfy a set of equations.</h3>

<h4>1. Gauss elimination </h4>
Works in two phases: elimination and substitution. The elimination transforms the equations into Ux = c. The equations are solved by back substitution.
<h4>2. LU decomposition</h4>
<h4>3. Cholesky decomposition</h4>
